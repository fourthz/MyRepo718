Geophrey Odero EDRM 718 GitHub Repo

You obviously have learned how to create and clone a repo, but you have not
done much in the way of organization that will support a large project. There
are no folders (I stated that I require a data folder that contains all data).
You may want to consider, for example, a folder for data files, notebooks, and
instructor notes.

You also do not have a .gitignore file. Currently you have a number of
non-essential and non-text files in your repo. You should have a .gitignore
that minimally contains:

*.html
*.xlsx
*.pdf

Remember that you can do this organization on your computer at any time and
then just push the revised repo.
